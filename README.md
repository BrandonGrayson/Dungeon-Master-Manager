## Description

    
 Dungeon Master Manager (DMM) is a full stack application powered by Node.js and Express.js. You can create a unique profile to keep your Dungeons & Dragons adventures organized. As a dungeon master, you need to keep track of all the characters in your game and keep track of where you are in the story. Using DMM, you can go into your profile and select which saved game you want to look up. You can see all of the characters that are involved within the game and even add new characters! Unleash your inner master and take control of your dungeon!
